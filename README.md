# Facial-Recognition-and-emotional-analysis
Developed a deep learning–based system for facial recognition and emotion analysis. Explored classical computer vision methods by implementing face detection with Haar Cascade and face recognition using OpenCV’s LBPHFaceRecognizer. Additionally, trained a CNN on the FER-2013 dataset for 7-class emotion recognition.
